Description:
Protothreads are extremely lightweight stackless threads designed for severely
memory constrained systems, such as small embedded systems or wireless sensor
network nodes. Protothreads provide linear code execution for event-driven
systems implemented in C. Protothreads can be used with or without an underlying
operating system to provide blocking event-handlers. Protothreads provide
sequential flow of control without complex state machines or full
multi-threading.
